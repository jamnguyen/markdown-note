# Markdown Note 📝

Just a fun little markdown note app I built during my weekend coding sessions.

> **This is a vibe coding project** - built with exploration and experimentation in mind, no strict planning, just coding and seeing where it goes! This README file is also generated by AI as well. 😝

Sometimes you just want to write some markdown without worrying about cloud sync, accounts, or any of that fancy stuff. This app keeps everything local on your machine - no internet required, no data collection, just you and your notes.

## How I Built This

This is a pet project built with an exploratory approach - starting simple and adding features as needed. Here's the tech stack:

### Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Material-UI** - Component library for consistent UI
- **CodeMirror** - Code editor with markdown support
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **LocalForage** - Local storage wrapper for IndexedDB
- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop application

### Development Approach

- Started with a basic note-taking interface
- Gradually added markdown editing and preview
- Implemented theming and customization options
- Focused on local storage for privacy and simplicity
- Embraced the vibe coding philosophy - no roadmaps, just building what feels right
